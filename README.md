# Planning for Active Perception for Planetary Exploration Rovers

---

## Overview
This project implements an active perception method proposed in "[Active localization for planetary rovers](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7500599)" 
that generates paths while leveraging path efficiency and localization error. We compare Error Propagation A* (EPA*) and A* in terms of planned path cost, localization 
uncertainty, and generalization ability against several maps generated randomly.
